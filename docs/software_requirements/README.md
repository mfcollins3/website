# Software Requirements

This document and child documents present the list of required software that you will need if you wish to build and run my website locally from source code. Please review these document and ensure that your development is properly configured and the required software is installed before attempting to clone the GitHub repository and run the website.

## Platform Requirements

My personal website can be built and run on Apple macOS, Linux, or Microsoft Windows. Not all required software needs to be installed on or is compatible with all platforms. Each software package description includes a table that indicates whether the software product is required for the platform. The following symbols are used to indicate whether a software package is required:

- :white_check_mark:: The software package is required to be installed on this platform,
- :grey_question:: The software package is compatible with this platform, but its installation and use is optional,
- :x:: The software package is not compatible with this platform.
